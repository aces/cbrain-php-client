When generating this library using the online
Swagger CodeGen, edit the CodeGen options for
the PHP client:

  composerProjectName: aces/cbrain-php-client
  gitRepoBaseURL: https://github.com
  gitRepoId: aces/cbrain-php-client

This will allow you to generate exactly
the library in the first commit of this repo.

However, there are still a few modifications to
make to the README.md and the composer.json.
These are shown in the subsequent commits.

I don't really undertand PHP and Composer,
so I created this based on what I saw in
the other old repo "xlecours/cbrain-php-client".
